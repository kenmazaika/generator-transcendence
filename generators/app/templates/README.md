# Firehose React WebPack Front-end

WebPack is an amazing tool that provides an awesome developer experience after initial setup.  This is my base configuration for a web application that runs with:

* WebPack
* React
* Redux
* SASS
* Twitter Bootstrap 3
* lodash
* Babel

And also supports WebPackDevServer.

This project is meant to transcend the web.  Transcendence.
